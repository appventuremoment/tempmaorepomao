the 3d models arent bad but it needs a good reference. it might generate with some useless bits like the sky (???) and there is no way to use text to tell it not to do that

there is a bg remover so thats that

gemini image is so dog i dont get it
there are many others which i dont know how to run for free or locally (without ui)
the one from tencent doesnt have clear instructions i wish they did. maybe if i understood chinese better i could look up bilibili

bg remover takes 10s
3d model takes 360s 
image takes 30s
